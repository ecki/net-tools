                               INSTALLING

Please read the file `README' before you start with the installation of the
net-tools.


HACKERS WAY
-----------
cd /usr/src ; tar xvzf net-tools*.tar.gz
apt install libbluetooth-dev libselinux1-dev gettext build-essential
less Makefile ; make config ; make ; make -n install
sudo make install



CONFIGURE
---------
First of all, change into the net-tools directory.

Before you start with the Installation please have a look into the toplevel
Makefile. There are some configuration options with explanations.

To configure the compilation use "make config".  The default answers should
be safe for most configurations (bluetooth and selinux required).


COMPILE
-------
To compile simply use "make -j".

There should be no warnings or errors.



INSTALLATION
------------
If you want to install the binaries use "make install".

To change the default permissions and ownerships of the installed binaries and
manpages edit the Makefile. You can test the installation with "make -n install".
This will tell make: Don't run any commands, just print them.
