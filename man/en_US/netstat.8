Replacement for \fBnetstat\fR is \fBss\fR.
Replacement for \fBnetstat -r\fR is \fBip route\fR.
Replacement for \fBnetstat -i\fR is \fBip -s link\fR.
Replacement for \fBnetstat -g\fR is \fBip maddr\fR.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Netstat
prints information about the Linux networking subsystem.

.SS Invocation Mode
The type of
information printed is controlled by the first argument, as follows:

.TP
(none)
By default,
.B netstat
displays a list of open sockets.  If you don't specify any
address families, then the active sockets of all configured address
families will be printed.
.TP
.BR \-\-route ", " \-r
Display the kernel routing tables. See the description in
.BR route (8)
for details.
.B netstat -r
and
.B route -e
produce the same output.
.TP
.BR \-\-groups ", " \-g
Display multicast group membership information for IPv4 and IPv6.
.TP
.BR \-\-interfaces ", " \-i
Display a table of all network interfaces and their respective
reception and transmission errors counters. Without the \fB--extended\fP option
it produces same output as \fBifconfig -s\fP, otherwise the detailed list.
.TP
.BR \-\-masquerade ", " \-M
Display a list of masqueraded connections.
.TP
.BR \-\-statistics ", " \-s
Display summary (SNMP) statistics for each protocol.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-\-verbose ", " \-v
Tell the user what is going on by being verbose. Especially print some
useful information about unconfigured address families.
.TP
.BR \-\-wide ", " \-W
Do not truncate addresses by using output as wide as needed. This is
optional for now to not break existing scripts.
.TP
.BR \-\-numeric ", " \-n
Show numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic host, port
or user names.
.TP
.B \-\-numeric\-hosts
shows numerical host addresses but does not affect the resolution of
port or user names.
.TP
.B \-\-numeric\-ports
shows numerical port numbers but does not affect the resolution of
host or user names.
.TP
.B \-\-numeric\-users
shows numerical user IDs but does not affect the resolution of host or
port names.
.TP
\fB\-\-protocol=\fIFamily\fR, \fB\-A\fP \fIFamily\fP
Specifies the address families (perhaps better described as low level
protocols) for which connections are to be shown.
.I Family
is a comma ('\fB,\fR') separated list of address family keywords like
.BR inet ,
.BR inet6 ,
.BR unix ,
.BR ipx ,
.BR ax25 ,
.BR netrom ,
.BR econet ,
.BR ddp ,
and
.BR bluetooth .
.br
This has the same effect as using the
.BR \-\-inet | -4 ,
.BR \-\-inet6 | -6 ,
.BR \-\-unix | -x ,
.BR \-\-ipx ,
.BR \-\-ax25 ,
.BR \-\-netrom ,
.BR \-\-ddp ,
and
.B \-\-bluetooth
options.

The address family
.B inet
(IPv4) includes raw, udp, udplite and tcp protocol sockets.

The address family
.B bluetooth
includes l2cap and rfcomm protocol sockets.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-continuous
This will cause
.B netstat
to print the selected information every second continuously.
.TP
.BR \-e ", " \-\-extend
Display additional information.  Use this option twice for maximum detail.
.TP
.BR \-o ", " \-\-timers
Include information related to networking timers.
.TP
.BR \-p ", " \-\-program
Show the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.
A hyphen is shown if the socket belongs to the kernel (e.g. a kernel service,
or the process has exited but the socket hasn't finished closing yet).
.TP
.BR \-l ", " \-\-listening
Show only listening sockets.  (These are omitted by default.)
.TP
.BR \-a ", " \-\-all
Show both listening and non-listening sockets.  With the
.B \-\-interfaces
option, show interfaces that are not up
.TP
.B \-F
Print routing information from the FIB.  (This is the default.)
.TP
.B \-C
Print routing information from the route cache.
(The cache is no longer provided with Linux kernel 3.6).

.SH OUTPUT

.SS Active Internet connections \fR(TCP, UDP, UDPLite, raw)\fR
.TP
.B Proto
The protocol (tcp, udp, udpl, raw) used by the socket.
.TP
.B Recv\-Q
Established: The count of bytes not copied by the user program
connected to this socket.
.br
Listening: Since Kernel 2.6.18 this column contains the current accept queue.
.TP
.B Send\-Q
Established: The count of bytes not acknowledged by the remote host.
.br
Listening: Since Kernel 2.6.18 this column contains the maximum size
of the syn backlog.
.TP
.B Local Address
Address and port number of the local end of the socket.  Unless the
.BR \-\-numeric " (" \-n )
option is specified, the socket address is resolved to its canonical
host name (FQDN), and the port number is translated into the
corresponding service name.
.TP
.B Foreign Address
Address and port number of the remote end of the socket.
Analogous to "Local Address".
.TP
.B State
The state of the socket. Since there are no states in raw mode and usually no
states used in UDP and UDPLite, this column may be left blank.
Normally this can be one of several values:
.RS
.TP
.I ESTABLISHED
The socket has an established connection.
.TP
.I SYN_SENT
The socket is actively attempting to establish a connection.
.TP
.I SYN_RECV
A connection request has been received from the network.
.TP
.I FIN_WAIT1
The socket is closed, and the connection is shutting down.
.TP
.I FIN_WAIT2
Connection is closed, and the socket is waiting for a shutdown from the
remote end.
.TP
.I TIME_WAIT
The socket is waiting after close to handle packets still in the network.
.TP
.I CLOSE
The socket is not being used.
.TP
.I CLOSE_WAIT
The remote end has shut down, waiting for the socket to close.
.TP
.I LAST_ACK
The remote end has shut down, and the socket is closed. Waiting for
acknowledgement.
.TP
.I LISTEN
The socket is listening for incoming connections.  Such sockets are
not included in the output unless you specify the
.BR \-\-listening " (" \-l )
or
.BR \-\-all " (" \-a )
option.
.TP
.I CLOSING
Both sockets are shut down but we still don't have all our data
sent.
.TP
.I UNKNOWN
The state of the socket is unknown.
.RE

.TP
.B "User"
The username or the user id (UID) of the owner of the socket.
.TP
.B  "PID/Program name"
Slash-separated pair of the process id (PID) and process name of the
process that owns the socket.
.B \-\-program
causes this column to be included.  You will also need
.I superuser
privileges to see this information on sockets you don't own.  This
identification information is not yet available for IPX sockets.
.TP
.B  "Timer"
TCP timer associated with this socket. The format is timer(a/b/c).
The timer is one of the following values:

.RS
.TP
.I off
There is no timer set for this socket.
.TP
.I on
The retransmission timer is active for the socket.
.TP
.I keepalive
The keepalive timer is active for the socket.
.TP
.I timewait
The connection is closing and the timewait timer is active for the socket.

The values in the brackets:

.RS
.TP
.I a
Timer value.
.TP
.I b
Number of retransmissions sent.
.TP
.I c
Number of keepalives sent.
.RE
.RE

.TP
.B "Flags"
The flags displayed is SO_ACCEPTON (displayed as
.BR ACC ),
SO_WAITDATA
.RB ( W )
or SO_NOSPACE
.RB ( N ).
SO_ACCECPTON
is used on unconnected sockets if their corresponding
processes are waiting for a connect request. The other flags are not
of normal interest.
.TP
.B "Type"
There are several types of socket access:

.RS
.TP
.I SOCK_DGRAM
The socket is used in Datagram (connectionless) mode.
.TP

More info available in
.B "Active Internet connections"
section written above.
.TP
.B  "Path"
This is the path name as which the corresponding processes attached
to the socket.

.SS Active IPX sockets
(this needs to be done by somebody who knows it)

.SS Active NET/ROM sockets
(this needs to be done by somebody who knows it)

.SS Active AX.25 sockets
(this needs to be done by somebody who knows it)

.SS Kernel Interface table (-i)
Output format depends on the \fB\-\-extended\fP flag.
if not specified the output is compatible to the short \fBifconfig \-s\fP
statistics table, otherwise the detailed interface list is used.
Both documented in
.BR ifconfig (8).

.SS Kernel IP routing table (-r)
Output format depends on the \fB\-\-extended\fP flags.
If not specified the output is the same as \fBroute \-e\fP.
If one is specified, the output is the same as \fBroute\fP default format.
If the extended option is specified twice,
the output is same as \fBroute \-ee\fP.
All three documented in
.BR route (8).

.SH BUGS
Occasionally strange information may appear if a socket changes
as it is viewed. This is unlikely to occur.

The performance when listing large number of sockets on busy servers
is low, use the
.BR netlink (7)
based
.BR ss (8)
command instead.
