                Information about the net-tools package

NET-TOOLS	A collection of programs that form the base set of the
            NET-3 networking distribution for the Linux operating
            system.

This package includes the legacy tools for controlling the network
subsystem of the Linux kernel.  This includes arp, hostname, ifconfig,
netstat, rarp and route.  Additionally, this package contains
utilities relating to particular network hardware types (plipconfig,
slattach, mii-tool) and advanced aspects of IP configuration (iptunnel,
ipmaddr).

Please include the output of "program --version" when reporting bugs.

                          Notes
                          -----

This is net-tools HEAD.

These have largely been tested against Linux kernels 2.6+.  They might work
against older ones if anyone actually still cares about those anymore.

They have largely been tested against recent glibc versions, but should work
on any POSIX compliant C library.  If you notice portability issues, please
flie a bug for us (or even send a patch!).

The NLS support by Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo <acme@conectiva.com.br> uses GNU
gettext.  Translations to Brazilian Portuguese (pt_BR), German (de), Estonian
(ee), Czech (cz), French (fr) and Japanese (ja) are available.  Others are
welcome!

The translated man pages are planned to be moved to the manpages-i10n
project in the next release. Thanks to Helge Kreutzmann.

net-tools is generally considered deprecated, in most cases use
the iproute2 package instead.
